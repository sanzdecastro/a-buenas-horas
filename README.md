## About
### Concept

The expression 'A buenas horas mangas verdes' is used to criticize someone's delay in addressing a need or solving a problem, as either the issue has already been resolved or their help is no longer needed.

The 'mangas verdes' were the squad members of the Santa Hermandad, who wore green and were responsible for apprehending and imprisoning wrongdoers in rural areas. They gained a reputation for arriving late, after the thieves had already escaped. Hence, the commonly used expression.
